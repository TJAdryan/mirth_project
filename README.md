Lab Results Integration Project
Project Summary
This project demonstrates a core healthcare interoperability workflow: the transformation of clinical lab results from the HL7 v2 standard to the FHIR standard. Using the Mirth Connect integration engine, a real-world, sanitized data set is received, processed, and transformed into a FHIR Observation resource. The final resource is sent to a simulated RESTful API endpoint, mimicking a real-world integration between a lab information system and a clinic's EHR.

Challenges Addressed
This project demonstrates how to solve common challenges faced by healthcare integration engineers:

Parsing Complex HL7 Messages: Successfully extracting clinical data from the hierarchical structure of an HL7 ORU^R01 message, including the OBR and OBX segments.

FHIR Resource Construction: Building a robust and valid FHIR Observation resource with complex data types (CodeableConcept, Quantity, Reference) to accurately represent a lab result.

Integration Engine Proficiency: Configuring a Mirth Connect channel from end-to-end, including file-based sources, HTTP destinations, and JavaScript transformers, to create a functional and reliable integration.

RESTful API Interaction: Correctly formatting and sending a FHIR resource in a POST request to a simulated API, demonstrating an understanding of modern interoperability standards.

Core Project Components
Data Source
The project uses a real-world, sanitized data set generated by Synthea, an open-source patient data generator. Using this data demonstrates an understanding of professional best practices for working with healthcare information without violating privacy laws.

The Input: HL7 ORU^R01 Message
This is the raw message received from the simulated lab system. It contains patient demographics in the PID segment and the lab result in the OBX segment.

The Transformation: JavaScript Mapping
The Mirth Connect transformer maps the fields from the HL7 message to the FHIR Observation resource. The mapping logic includes:

Extracting the patient ID from PID.3.1 and mapping it to the subject field.

Extracting the test name from OBR.4.2 and the value from OBX.5 to construct the FHIR code and valueQuantity elements.

Mapping the units from OBX.6.

The Output: FHIR Observation Resource
This is the final JSON output of the channel, which is ready to be consumed by the clinic's EHR system.

How to Run the Project
Configure the Channel: Create a new Mirth Connect channel.

Source: Use a File Reader connector to watch a directory (e.g., ~/mirth-data/in).

Transformation: Use the HL7 ORU^R01 and FHIR Observation messages provided above as templates for your drag-and-drop mapping.

Destination: Use an HTTP Sender connector to send the transformed message to a mock API endpoint.

Deploy the Channel: From the Mirth Connect dashboard, deploy the channel.

Test the Integration: Place a copy of the sample HL7 ORU^R01 message into your source directory. The channel will automatically pick up the file, transform it, and send the FHIR Observation resource to the API endpoint. You can verify the output on the mock API's log.
